# Gen and Share

My submission for [FlutterByte BuildWithAI Competition](https://twitter.com/flutterbytes_c/status/1792516443268878771?t=7GgqIx7ey0kDBc4tj6TBTA&s=19).

## How it works
- User provides an "aspect" to be generated about.
- User can also provide a name that the generated text would be persoolised to.
- Gemini does its work
- Share any text that satisfies you to wherever you want
